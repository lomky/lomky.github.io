# Resources for Computer Science Learning

These are the resources I consider worthwhile for gaining and improving your knowledge of computer science & programming. Most are focused on areas I have an interest in. There are many great resources I may not know to recommend, but I attest to the quality of the ones here.


## Introductory / Novice Level

**[Crash Course - Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo)** - this is a great introduction to the history and context of computer science. If you want to understand why computer programming works like it does today, you need a grounding in how we got here.  

**[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing)** - an extremely broad resource! Here you will find the resources to learn, test yourself, and get help from fellow learners.  

  - [Computer Programming](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming) will introduce you to javascript, a real world programming language. Follow it up with the the two [Advanced](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming-games-visualizations) Javascript [Courses](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming-natural-simulations)
  - [Intro to HTML/CSS: Making Webpages](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css) will show you how to create and design your own website. Then learn how to combine the with the Javascript you learned to [improve your website](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css-js)

High School Courses! - When you get to high school, you should find programming courses you can take.

**[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)** - a great site with tutorial problems you can solve in over a dozen various programming languages. Very helpful when learning a new language. Also runs programming competitions you can participate in.

## Intermediate Level

[Khan Academy - Algorithms](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science) - A great deep dive into one of the building blocks of computer programming.

[Khan Academy - Meet the Professional](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/meet-the-computing-professional) - get an idea of what real life computer scientists do!

[Khan Academy - Animation](https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/pixar) - If you're interested in working in Animation, Khan Academy paired up with [Pixar](https://www.pixar.com/) to offer this course!

## Continuing Professional Education

A computer scientist is never done learning. The profession continues to evolve, and we have to keep up! You can start taking these courses after getting through a couple of the intermediate courses.

[Ruby on Rails Web Development Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ruby-on-rails) - these courses focus on all the levels of programming you need to know to write a complete web application. If you take this series of courses after the introductory coursework above, you will have all the skills to work as an entry-level web developer. Coursera is currently offer the courses for free for audit-level, but in most courses grading yourself is very feasible.  
I have been working through these courses myself, in order to contribute to Ruby on Rails based open source projects.
